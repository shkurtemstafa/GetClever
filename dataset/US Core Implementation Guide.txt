Introduction
This guide and the US Core profiles have become the foundation for US Realm FHIR implementation guides. This annual release reflects changes to U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) and comments and requests from the US Realm FHIR community. (The US Core Roadmap page outlines this approach to yearly updates.) US Core has benefitted from testing and guidance by the Argonaut Project Team. Their feedback continues to lay the groundwork for documenting the US Core Profile design, interactions, requirements, and guidelines for patient data access and Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy (ASTP) Certification testing. Under the guidance of HL7 and the HL7 US Realm Steering Committee, the content will expand in future versions to meet the needs specific to the US Realm.

The US Core Implementation Guide is based on FHIR Version R4. It defines the minimum constraints on the FHIR resources to create the US Core Profiles. The elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets that SHALL be present are identified, and how they are used is defined. It also documents the minimum FHIR RESTful interactions for each US Core Profiles to access patient data. Establishing the "floor" of standards to promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation allows for further standards development evolution for specific use cases. There are two different ways to implement US Core:

Profile Only Support: Systems may support only the US Core Profiles to represent clinical information.
Profile Support + Interaction Support: Systems may support both the US Core Profile content structure and the RESTful interactions defined for a resource.
For a detailed description of these different usages of US Core, see the Conformance Requirements page.

Background
The US Core requirements were initially developed, balloted, and published in FHIR DSTU2 as part of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) sponsored Data Access Framework (DAF) project. The Argonaut Data Query Implementation Guide superseded DAF and documented security and authorization and the querying of the 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS) and static documents. US Core descended directly from the Argonaut guide to support FHIR Version STU3 and eventually FHIR R4 and the ASTP/ONC U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI). Refer to the USCDI page which maps the US Core versions and profiles to the USCDI versions and Data Elements.

How To Read This Guide
This Guide is divided into several pages, which are listed at the top of each page in the menu bar.

Home: The home page provides the introduction and background for US Core.
Conformance: These pages describe the set of rules to claim conformance to this guide
General Requirements: This page defines requirements common to all actors and profiles used in this guide, including how CapabilityStatements are used to claim conformance.
Must Support: This page defines the expectations for mandatory and Must Support elements in the US Core Profiles.
Guidance: The Guidance pages document best practices and how to use the profiles and transactions defined in this guide.
USCDI: This page maps the US Core Profiles to the (USCDI) data classes and data elements.
General Guidance: This page provides guidance, definitions, and requirements common to all actors and profiles used in this guide.
Clinical Notes: This page provides guidance on the interactions between Consumers and Producers of clinical notes.
Medication List: This page provides guidance on how a patient or provider can access a patient's medications.
Basic Provenance: This page provides implementers with important definitions to create and share the Provenance Resource.
Screening and Assessments: This page documents how US Core Profiles are used to represent screenings and assessments for patient health status
Changes Between Versions: This page considers the user and developer experience when transitioning between versions of US Core and documents the changes between versions.
FHIR Artifacts: These pages provide detailed descriptions and formal definitions for all the FHIR objects defined in this guide.
Profiles and Extensions: This page lists the US Core Profiles and Extensions defined in this guide to exchange quality data.
Each US Core Profile page includes a narrative description that lists all the Mandatory and Must Support data elements, profile-specific implementation guidance, and formal definitions. A "Quick Start" guide summarizes the supported search transactions for each profile. Although the guidance typically focuses on the profiled elements, it also may cover un-profiled elements to aid with implementation and certification.
Search Parameters and Operations: This page lists the defined US Core Operations and Search Parameters used in US Core transactions.
Terminology: This page lists the US Core ValueSets, and CodeSystems defined for the profiles.
Capability Statements: These pages define the expected FHIR capabilities of the US Core Servers and Clients.
Security: This page documents the general security requirements and recommendations for actors.
Examples: This page lists all the examples used in this guide. These examples show what data produced and consumed by systems conforming with this implementation guide might look like. Every effort has been made to ensure that the examples are correct and useful, but they are not a normative part of the specification, nor fully representative of real-world examples.
Downloads: This page provides links to downloadable artifacts.
Change Log: This page documents the changes across the versions of US Core. It is a vital resource for implementers, developers, and stakeholders to understand the guide’s progression.
Looking Ahead: These pages provide a preview of the future direction of US Core
US Core Roadmap: This page outlines the approach to adding new content to US Core.
Writing Vital Signs: This page documents how to write vital sign Observation using patient- and provider-facing apps.
Patient Data Feed: This page documents how to use FHIR Subscriptions to be notified when events related to US Core content occur.
US Core Actors
The following actors are part of the US Core IG:

US Core Requestor
A US Core Requester is an application that initiates a data access request to retrieve patient data. The US Core Requestor is the Client in a Client-Server interaction. The terms "US Core Requestor" and "Client" are used interchangeably throughout this guide and are not meant to limit this actor to only patient and provider apps. For example, payers and other users can use the same technology. These terms are a short-hand notation for "user application".

US Core Responder
A US Core Responder is a system that responds to the data access request providing patient data. The US Core responder is the Server in a Client-Server interaction. The terms "US Core Responder", "Server", and "EHR" are used interchangeably throughout this guide and are not meant to limit this actor to electronic health record systems. For example, HIEs, care coordination platforms, population health systems, etc., can use the same technology. These terms are a short-hand notation for "interoperable healthcare platform".

US Core Profiles
Below is the list of US Core Profiles. Each profile identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and ValueSets SHALL be present in the resource when using this profile. Together, they promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation and provide the floor for standards development for specific use cases. See the USCDI page, for a mapping to the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI).

A simple narrative summary gives each profile's requirements and guidance. A formal hierarchical table presents a logical view of the content in both a differential and snapshot view, and provides references to appropriate terminologies and examples.

US Core Profile Maturity
All US Core FHIR conformance and terminology artifacts are assigned a FHIR Maturity Level. The content in this release has been thoroughly reviewed through the HL7 ballot and other processes, implemented, and subject to ASTP certification testing. A FHIR Maturity Level of FMM 3 is assigned to US Core artifacts associated with a USCDI Data Class or Element and subject to regulation and ASTP certification. A FHIR Maturity Level of FMM 2 is assigned to US Core artifacts related to a USCDI Data Class or Element but have not yet been identified in regulation or subject to ASTP certification. All other US Core artifacts have been assigned a FHIR Maturity Level of FMM 3 based upon community review. Refer to the FHIR specification for more information about maturity levels.

The US Core AllergyIntolerance Profile inherits from the FHIR AllergyIntolerance resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile sets minimum expectations for the AllergyIntolerance resource to record, search, and fetch allergies/adverse reactions associated with a patient. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets SHALL be present and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.

Example Usage Scenarios:

The following are example usage scenarios for the US Core AllergyIntolerance profile:

Query for Allergies belonging to a Patient
Record or update a Patient Allergy
Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements
The following data elements must always be present (Mandatory definition) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system (Must Support definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation. Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well. The Formal Views below provides the formal summary, definitions, and terminology requirements.

Each AllergyIntolerance Must Have:

a clinical status of the allergy (e.g., active or resolved)*
a code that tells you what the patient is allergic to
a patient
Each AllergyIntolerance Must Support:

a verification status
a reaction manifestation
Additional USCDI Requirements:

These Additional USCDI Requirements elements are not Mandatory or Must Support but are required for ASTP Health IT certification testing and are included in the formal definition of the profile and the AllergyIntolerance examples.

a recorder*
*see guidance below

Profile Specific Implementation Guidance:

* The AllergyIntolerance.clinicalStatus element has the following constraints: SHALL be present if verification status is not "entered-in-error" and SHALL NOT be present if verification Status is "entered-in-error".
No Known Allergies may be represented using the US Core-AllergyIntolerance profile with the appropriate negation code in AllergyIntolerence.code and the appropriate verification status in AllergyIntolerance.verificationStatus.

If a patient has not been asked about their allergies, this would be represented as:

AllergyIntolerance.code = "1631000175102" (Patient not asked (contextual qualifier) (qualifier value))
AllergyIntolerance.verificationStatus = "unconfirmed" or empty (in other words, then element omitted)
If a patient has been asked, but has indicated they have no known allergies, this would be represented as:

AllergyIntolerance.code = "716186003" (No known allergy (situation))
AllergyIntolerance.verificationStatus = "confirmed"
*The profile elements AllergyIntolerance.asserter and AllergyIntolerance.recorder communicate the individual level provenance author data corresponding to the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Provenance Author Data Elements.
Usages:

Examples for this Profile: AllergyIntolerance/example and AllergyIntolerance/non-pharmacologic-agent-example
CapabilityStatements using this Profile: US Core Client CapabilityStatement and US Core Server CapabilityStatement

Summary

Mandatory: 1 element
Must-Support: 6 elements

Structures

This structure refers to these other structures:

US Core Patient Profile (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient)
US Core Practitioner Profile (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-practitioner)
US Core RelatedPerson Profile (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-relatedperson)
Maturity: 3

 

Other representations of profile: CSV, Excel, Schematron

Notes:
Quick Start

Below is an overview of the required Server RESTful FHIR interactions for this profile - for example, search and read operations - when supporting the US Core interactions to access this profile's information (Profile Support + Interaction Support). Note that systems that support only US Core Profiles (Profile Only Support) are not required to support these interactions. See the US Core Server CapabilityStatement for a complete list of supported RESTful interactions for this IG.

See the Scopes Format section for a description of the SMART scopes syntax.
See the Search Syntax section for a description of the US Core search syntax.
See the General Requirements section for additional rules and expectations when a Server requires status parameters.
See the General Guidance section for additional guidance on searching for multiple patients.
US Core Scopes
Servers providing access to allergy and intolerance data SHALL support these US Core SMART Scopes:

resource level scopes: <patient|user|system>/AllergyIntolerance.rs
Mandatory Search Parameters:
The following search parameters and search parameter combinations SHALL be supported:

SHALL support searching for all allergies for a patient using the patient search parameter:

GET [base]/AllergyIntolerance?patient={Type/}[id]

Example:

GET [base]/AllergyIntolerance?patient=1137192
Implementation Notes: Fetches a bundle of all AllergyIntolerance resources for the specified patient (how to search by reference)

Optional Search Parameters:
The following search parameter combinations SHOULD be supported:

SHOULD support searching using the combination of the patient and clinical-status search parameters:

GET [base]/AllergyIntolerance?patient={Type/}[id]&clinical-status={system|}[code]

Example:
GET [base]/AllergyIntolerance?patient=[id]&clinical-status=http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/allergyintolerance-clinical|active
Implementation Notes: Fetches a bundle of all AllergyIntolerance resources for the specified patient and status code. This will not return any "entered in error" resources because of the conditional presence of the clinicalStatus element. (how to search by reference and how to search by token)

US Core FHIR RESTful interactions
For systems that support the US Core Profile content structure and the RESTful interactions defined for a resource, the requirements are formally defined in the US Core CapabilityStatements. In addition, each profile page has a Quick Start Section that documents the required FHIR RESTful search and read operations. These sections demonstrate how to access a patient's clinical and administrative data:

Example of a simple FHIR RESTful Search Transaction
basic_fhir_restful_interaction.svg

Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements
The following data elements must always be present (Mandatory definition) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system (Must Support definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation. Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well. The Formal Views below provides the formal summary, definitions, and terminology requirements.

Each CarePlan Must Have:

a status
a category
an intent
a patient
Each CarePlan Must Support:

a narrative summary of the patient assessment and plan of treatment*
a category code of "assess-plan"
Additional USCDI Requirements:

These Additional USCDI Requirements elements are not Mandatory or Must Support but are required for ASTP Health IT certification testing and are included in the formal definition of the profile and the CarePlan examples.

a contributor*
*see guidance below

Profile Specific Implementation Guidance:

*The original Assessment and Plan design in the CarePlan was to support the "Assessment and Plan" from a narrative Progress Note. Systems have advanced significantly since the introduction of this requirement in 2015. Relaxing this to 0..1 allows more sophisticated systems to discretely encode a CarePlan instead of providing the narrative portion.
Additional considerations for systems aligning with HL7 Consolidated (C-CDA) Care Plan requirements:
US Core Goal SHOULD be present in CarePlan.goal
US Core Condition SHOULD be present in CarePlan.addresses
Assessment and Plan MAY be included as narrative in CarePlan.text
As an alternative to the US Core CarePlan, Assessment and Plan of Treatment may be included in various types of Clinical Notes, such as Progress Notes, History & Physical (H&P), Discharge Summaries, etc.
*The profile element CarePlan.contributor communicates the individual level provenance author data corresponding to the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Provenance Author Data Elements.

Notes:
Quick Start

Below is an overview of the required Server RESTful FHIR interactions for this profile - for example, search and read operations - when supporting the US Core interactions to access this profile's information (Profile Support + Interaction Support). Note that systems that support only US Core Profiles (Profile Only Support) are not required to support these interactions. See the US Core Server CapabilityStatement for a complete list of supported RESTful interactions for this IG.

See the Scopes Format section for a description of the SMART scopes syntax.
See the Search Syntax section for a description of the US Core search syntax.
See the General Requirements section for additional rules and expectations when a Server requires status parameters.
See the General Guidance section for additional guidance on searching for multiple patients.
US Core Scopes
Servers providing access to care plan data SHALL support these US Core SMART Scopes:

resource level scopes: <patient|user|system>/CarePlan.rs
Mandatory Search Parameters:
The following search parameters and search parameter combinations SHALL be supported:

SHALL support searching using the combination of the patient and category search parameters:

GET [base]/CarePlan?patient={Type/}[id]&category=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/CodeSystem/careplan-category|assess-plan

Example:

GET [base]/CarePlan?patient=1137192&category=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/CodeSystem/careplan-category|assess-plan
Implementation Notes: Fetches a bundle of all CarePlan resources for the specified patient and category=assess-plan (how to search by reference and how to search by token)

Optional Search Parameters:
The following search parameter combinations SHOULD be supported:

SHOULD support searching using the combination of the patient and category and date search parameters:
including support for these date comparators: gt,lt,ge,le
including optional support for AND search on date (e.g.date=[date]&date=[date]]&...)
GET [base]/CarePlan?patient={Type/}[id]&category=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/CodeSystem/careplan-category|assess-plan&date={gt|lt|ge|le}[date]{&date={gt|lt|ge|le}[date]&...}

Example:

GET [base]/CarePlan?patient=1137192&category=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/CodeSystem/careplan-category|assess-plan&date=ge2019-01-01T00:00:00Z

The US Core CareTeam Profile inherits from the FHIR CareTeam resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile sets minimum expectations for the CareTeam resource for identifying the Care Team members associated with a patient to promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets SHALL be present in the resource and how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.

Example Usage Scenarios:

The following are example usage scenarios for this profile:

Query for a Patient's CareTeam
Record or update a Patient's CareTeam
Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements
The following data elements must always be present (Mandatory definition) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system (Must Support definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation. Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well. The Formal Views below provides the formal summary, definitions, and terminology requirements.

Each CareTeam Must Have:

a patient
a participant role for each careteam member
a reference to each careteam member, which can be:
a practitioner or practitioner type (doctor, nurse, therapist)*
a relative, friend, or guardian
*See below for how practitioner members are represented in this Profile.

Each CareTeam Must Support:

a status code
Profile Specific Implementation Guidance:

In order to access care team member's names, identifiers, locations, and contact information, the CareTeam profile supports several types of care team participants. They are represented as references to other profiles and include the following three profiles, which are marked as Must Support:

US Core Practitioner Profile
US Core PractitionerRole Profile
US Core RelatedPerson Profile
Although both US Core Practitioner Profile and US Core PractitionerRole are Must Support, the Server system is not required to support references to both, but SHALL support at least one of them.
The Client application SHALL support all three profile references.
Because the US Core PractitionerRole Profile supplies the provider's location and contact information and a reference to the Practitioner, Server systems SHOULD reference it instead of the US Core Practitioner Profile. The quick start section below shows an example of how to access the practitioner name and identifier.
Servers that support only US Core Practitioner Profile and do not support the US Core PractitionerRole Profile SHALL provide implementation-specific guidance on how to access a provider's location and contact information using only the Practitioner resource.
Usages:

Refer to this Profile: US Core Average Blood Pressure Profile, US Core Care Experience Preference Profile, US Core CarePlan Profile, US Core CareTeam Profile... Show 12 more
Examples for this Profile: US-Core example CareTeam and US-Core example CareTeam

Other representations of profile: CSV, Excel, Schematron

Notes:
Quick Start

Below is an overview of the required Server RESTful FHIR interactions for this profile - for example, search and read operations - when supporting the US Core interactions to access this profile's information (Profile Support + Interaction Support). Note that systems that support only US Core Profiles (Profile Only Support) are not required to support these interactions. See the US Core Server CapabilityStatement for a complete list of supported RESTful interactions for this IG.

See the Scopes Format section for a description of the SMART scopes syntax.
See the Search Syntax section for a description of the US Core search syntax.
See the General Requirements section for additional rules and expectations when a Server requires status parameters.
See the General Guidance section for additional guidance on searching for multiple patients.
US Core Scopes
Servers providing access to careteam data SHALL support these US Core SMART Scopes:

resource level scopes: <patient|user|system>/CareTeam.rs
Mandatory Search Parameters:
The following search parameters and search parameter combinations SHALL be supported:

SHALL support searching using the combination of the patient and status search parameters:
including optional support for these _include parameters: CareTeam:participant:PractitionerRole,CareTeam:participant:Practitioner,CareTeam:participant:Patient,CareTeam:participant:RelatedPerson
including optional support for OR search on status (e.g.status={system|}[code],{system|}[code],...)
GET [base]/CareTeam?patient={Type/}[id]&status=active

Example:

GET [base]/CareTeam?patient=1137192&status=active
GET [base]/CareTeam?patient=1137192&status=active&_include=CareTeam:participant:RelatedPerson&_include=CareTeam:participant:Patient&_include=CareTeam:participant:Practitioner&_include=CareTeam:participant:PractitionerRole
Implementation Notes: Fetches a bundle of all CareTeam resources for the specified patient and status =active and may include CareTeam Patient, RelatedPerson and Practitioner and PractitionerRole participants.
To get Practitioner name and identifier using PractitionerRole:
1) Search for the careteam PractitionerRole: GET [base]/CareTeam?patient=[id]&status=active&_include=CareTeam:participant:PractitionerRole 2) Use the FHIR _id from the PractitionerRole.practitioner element, to fetch the Practitioner resources using GET [base]/Practitioner?_id=[id] (how to search by reference and how to search by token)

Optional Search Parameters:
The following search parameter combinations SHOULD be supported:

SHOULD support searching using the combination of the patient and role search parameters:
including optional support for these _include parameters: CareTeam:participant:PractitionerRole,CareTeam:participant:Practitioner,CareTeam:participant:Patient,CareTeam:participant:RelatedPerson
including optional support for OR search on role (e.g.role={system|}[code],{system|}[code],...)
GET [base]/CareTeam?patient={Type/}[id]&role={system|}[code]{,{system|}[code],...}

Resource Profile: US Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile

The US Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile inherits from the FHIR Condition resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. US Core version 5.0.0 split the US Core Condition Profile into this profile and the US Core Condition Problems and Health Concerns Profile. This profile meets the requirements of the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Encounter Diagnosis Data Element. It sets minimum expectations for the Condition resource to record, search, and fetch information about an encounter diagnosis. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets SHALL be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.

Example Usage Scenarios:

The following are example usage scenarios for this profile:

Query for a Patient's current or historical encounter diagnosis
Record or update a Patient's encounter diagnosis
Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements
The following data elements must always be present (Mandatory definition) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system (Must Support definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation. Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well. The Formal Views below provides the formal summary, definitions, and terminology requirements.

Each Condition Must Have:

a category code of 'encounter-diagnosis'
a code that identifies the condition*
a patient
Each Condition Must Support:

an encounter
date record was first recorded
Additional USCDI Requirements:

These Additional USCDI Requirements elements are not Mandatory or Must Support but are required for ASTP Health IT certification testing and are included in the formal definition of the profile and the Condition examples.

a recorder*
Profile Specific Implementation Guidance:

For Problems and Health Concerns, use the US Core Condition Problems and Health Concerns Profile.
*The Condition.code has an additional binding of "current" and a base "preferred" binding.
For the conformance rules on the current binding for coded data, review this section in the General Requirements page.
USCDI's applicable vocabulary standards for Encounter Diagnosis are SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM.
The US Core Condition Codes only supports ICD-9-CM for historical purposes. When using ICD codes, only non-header ICD-10-CM codes SHOULD be used as the primary code for current encounter diagnoses.
The encounter SHOULD always be referenced in Condition.encounter.
To search for an encounter diagnosis, query for Conditions that reference the Encounter of interest and have a category of encounter-diagnosis. An example search is shown in the Quick Start section below.
*The profile elements Condition.asserter and Condition.recorder communicate the individual level provenance author data corresponding to the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Provenance Author Data Elements.

Notes:
Quick Start

Below is an overview of the required Server RESTful FHIR interactions for this profile - for example, search and read operations - when supporting the US Core interactions to access this profile's information (Profile Support + Interaction Support). Note that systems that support only US Core Profiles (Profile Only Support) are not required to support these interactions. See the US Core Server CapabilityStatement for a complete list of supported RESTful interactions for this IG.

See the Scopes Format section for a description of the SMART scopes syntax.
See the Search Syntax section for a description of the US Core search syntax.
See the General Requirements section for additional rules and expectations when a Server requires status parameters.
See the General Guidance section for additional guidance on searching for multiple patients.
US Core Scopes
Servers providing access to encounter diagnosis data SHALL support these US Core SMART Scopes:

resource level scopes: <patient|user|system>/Condition.rs

Mandatory Search Parameters:
The following search parameters and search parameter combinations SHALL be supported:

SHALL support searching for all conditions including problems, health concerns, and encounter diagnosis for a patient using the patient search parameter:

GET [base]/Condition?patient={Type/}[id]

Example:

GET [base]/Condition?patient=1137192
Implementation Notes: Fetches a bundle of all Condition resources for the specified patient (how to search by reference)

Resource Profile: US Core Condition Problems and Health Concerns Profile 
Official URL: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-condition-problems-health-concerns	Version: 8.0.1
Standards status: Trial-use	Maturity Level: 3	Computable Name: USCoreConditionProblemsHealthConcernsProfile

Copyright/Legal: Used by permission of HL7 International, all rights reserved Creative Commons License


The US Core Condition Problems and Health Concerns Profile inherits from the FHIR Condition resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. US Core version 5.0.0 split the US Core Condition Profile into this profile and the US Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile. This profile meets the requirements of the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Problems, Health Concerns, and SDOH Problems/Health Concerns Data Elements. It sets minimum expectations for the Condition resource to record, search, and fetch information about a condition, diagnosis, or another event, situation, issue, or clinical concept documented and categorized as a problem or health concern, including information about a Social Determinants of Health related condition. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets SHALL be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.

Example Usage Scenarios:

The following are example usage scenarios for this profile:

Query for a Patient's current or historical problems and health concerns
Record or update a Patient's problems and health concerns
Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements
The following data elements must always be present (Mandatory definition) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system (Must Support definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation. Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well. The Formal Views below provides the formal summary, definitions, and terminology requirements.

Each Condition Must Have:

a category code of "problem-list-item" or "health-concern"
a code that identifies the condition*
a patient
Each Condition Must Support:

a timestamp when the resource last changed*
a clinical status of the condition (e.g., active or resolved)
a verification status
a date of diagnosis*
abatement date (in other words, date of resolution or remission)
a date when recorded*
Additional USCDI Requirements:

These Additional USCDI Requirements elements are not Mandatory or Must Support but are required for ASTP Health IT certification testing and are included in the formal definition of the profile and the Condition examples.

additional health status/assessment categories*
a recorder*
*see guidance below

Profile Specific Implementation Guidance:

For Encounter Diagnosis, use the US Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile.
*The Condition.code has an additional binding of "current" and a base "preferred" binding.
For the conformance rules on the current binding for coded data, review this section in the General Requirements page.
USCDI's applicable vocabulary standards for Problems/Health Concerns are SNOMED CT and ICD-10-CM.
The US Core Condition Codes only supports ICD-9-CM for historical purposes. When using ICD codes, only non-header ICD-10-CM codes SHOULD be used.
See the Screening and Assessments guidance page for more information when exchanging Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Problems/Health Concerns.
*The category of "problem-list-item" or "health-concern" is required, and, at a minimum, Certifying Systems SHALL support, a category of "sdoh", SHOULD support the other US Core Simple Observation Category codes, and MAY support other categories.
If the category is "problem-list-item", Condition.clinicalStatus SHOULD be present.
*There is no single element in Condition that represents the date of diagnosis. It may be the assertedDate Extension, Condition.onsetDateTime, or Condition.recordedDate.
Although all three are marked as Must Support, the Server is not required to support all.
A Server SHALL support Condition.recordedDate.
A Server SHALL support at least one of assertedDate Extension and Condition.onsetDateTime. A Server may support both, which means they support all 3 locations.
The Client application SHALL support all three elements
* See the US Core General Guidance page for Searching Using lastUpdated. Updates to .meta.lastUpdated SHOULD reflect:
New problems and health concerns
Changes in the clinical status or verifications status of problems or health concerns
*The profile elements Condition.asserter and Condition.recorder communicate the individual level provenance author data corresponding to the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Provenance Author Data Elements.
Usages:

Refer to this Profile: US Core Encounter Profile
Examples for this Profile: Condition/condition-SDOH-example, Condition/condition-duodenal-ulcer and Condition/health-concern-example

Notes:
Quick Start

Below is an overview of the required Server RESTful FHIR interactions for this profile - for example, search and read operations - when supporting the US Core interactions to access this profile's information (Profile Support + Interaction Support). Note that systems that support only US Core Profiles (Profile Only Support) are not required to support these interactions. See the US Core Server CapabilityStatement for a complete list of supported RESTful interactions for this IG.

See the Scopes Format section for a description of the SMART scopes syntax.
See the Search Syntax section for a description of the US Core search syntax.
See the General Requirements section for additional rules and expectations when a Server requires status parameters.
See the General Guidance section for additional guidance on searching for multiple patients.

Resource Profile: US Core Coverage Profile 
Official URL: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-coverage	Version: 8.0.1
Standards status: Trial-use	Maturity Level: 3	Computable Name: USCoreCoverageProfile

The US Core Coverage Profile inherits from the FHIR Coverage resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile meets the requirements of the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Health Insurance Information Data Class. It sets minimum expectations for the Coverage resource to record, search, and fetch data related to an individual's insurance coverage for health care. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets SHALL be present in the resource and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.

Example Usage Scenarios:

The following are example usage scenarios for this profile:

Query for a patient's insurance coverage
Record or update a past or present insurance coverage
Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements
The following data elements must always be present (Mandatory definition) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system (Must Support definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation. Profile-specific guidance and examples are provided as well. The Formal Views below provides the formal summary, definitions, and terminology requirements.

Each Coverage Must Have:

health insurance member identifier or subscriber id
a status
the health insurance beneficiary (patient)
beneficiary's relationship to the subscriber
the health insurance issuer (payer)
Each Coverage Must Support:

health insurance coverage type (e.g., Medicare)
coverage start or end date
health insurance group
health insurance plan
Profile Specific Implementation Guidance:

There is no single way to indicate that the patient has no coverage using the Coverage resource:
Coverage.status alone may not indicate whether an individual is covered. The Coverage.period needs to be considered as well. For example, the coverage may be expired with a status of "active", or conversely, it may be "canceled" but still have covered claims.
The absence of a Coverage resource instance may mean the patient has no coverage or the healthcare provider may not know it.
A coverage.type of "81" (Self-pay) MAY be used to imply that the patient has no coverage or that an individual or organization other than an insurer is taking responsibility for payment for a portion of the health care costs.
The hierarchical nature of the Coverage.type code system "Payer" (also known as the US Public Health Data Consortium Source of Payment Codes) may be unclear in the expansion, and some codes may be inappropriate for the use case. Implementers should refer to the PHDSC Payer Type Committee User's Guide for the Source of Payment Typology when selecting codes.

To differentiate Medicare Parts A, B, C, and D systems can use the following codes:

Medicare Plan	SOP Code (Description)	Comment
Part A and B	121 (Medicare Fee For Service)	Part A and B. Part A alone cannot be represented (see "Note to Balloters" below). Part B alone does not need to be represented because Part B enrollment requires enrollment in Part A
Part C (Medicare Advantage Plan)	111 (Medicare HMO)
112 (Medicare PPO)
113 (Medicare POS)	These are the most common types of Medicare Advantage Plans
Part D	122 (Medicare Drug Benefit)	 
The US Core team requested a stand-alone code for Medicare Part A from NAHDO. If this request is not approved, systems SHOULD use the X12 concept for Medicare Part A as a code translation to the SOP code "121" (see Using multiple codes with CodeableConcept Datatype).

If Insurers issue unique member IDs for dependents, then the memberId Coverage.identifier should be used instead of Coverage.dependent to uniquely refer to the dependent with respect to their insurance.

This structure is derived from Coverage

Summary

Mandatory: 1 element(1 nested mandatory element)
Must-Support: 16 elements

Structures

This structure refers to these other structures:

US Core Patient Profile (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient)
US Core Organization Profile (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-organization)
US Core RelatedPerson Profile (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-relatedperson)
Slices

This structure defines the following Slices:

The element 1 is sliced based on the value of Coverage.identifier
The element 1 is sliced based on the value of Coverage.class
Maturity: 3

 

Other representations of profile: CSV, Excel, Schematron

Notes:
Quick Start

Below is an overview of the required Server RESTful FHIR interactions for this profile - for example, search and read operations - when supporting the US Core interactions to access this profile's information (Profile Support + Interaction Support). Note that systems that support only US Core Profiles (Profile Only Support) are not required to support these interactions. See the US Core Server CapabilityStatement for a complete list of supported RESTful interactions for this IG.

See the Scopes Format section for a description of the SMART scopes syntax.
See the Search Syntax section for a description of the US Core search syntax.
See the General Requirements section for additional rules and expectations when a Server requires status parameters.
See the General Guidance section for additional guidance on searching for multiple patients.
US Core Scopes
Servers providing access to coverage data SHALL support these US Core SMART Scopes:

resource level scopes: <patient|user|system>/Coverage.rs
Mandatory Search Parameters:
SHALL support searching for all coverages for a patient using the patient search parameter:

GET [base]/Coverage?patient={Type/}[id]

Example:

GET [base]/Coverage?patient=1137192
Implementation Notes: Fetches a bundle of all Coverage resources for the specified patient (how to search by reference)
